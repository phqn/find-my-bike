 CS 147 Final Project

# Abstract
Our projectâ€™s idea stemmed from the anxiety of my bike being stolen. Going into a store while leaving it in the
parking lot, not knowing if it would be there when I got back. So we built a device that would alert me if my bike
were moved and would update my web server of its GPS location. The end product accomplished this goal but
with one caveat. The device has to be connected to the internet to communicate with the web server. To achieve
this we implemented a WiFi module. This does not allow us to get the GPS coordinates at all times, only when the
device is connected over a WiFi signal. However, it works as expected.
